I'm Max, I've been living in San Francisco for two and a half years.  I'm orginally from the east coast and I've been living for some time in Europe and India before moving here.  I currently work in product analytics at ancestry.com and I'm starting new job at Facebook in a few weeks.  I really enjoy hiking and backpacking and I just spent two weeks in the Swiss Alps.
